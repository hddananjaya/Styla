## 🆂🆃🆈🅻🅰  - Tiny Android App for Convert Texts to Stylish Texts
Styla is a tiny android application which allow users to design their conversations with cool and readable stylish unicodes. I hope to maintain this as a free and open-source project that anyone can edit/modify or learn something. Just done this for fun and this's my 101 android dev experience.
